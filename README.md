# Frontend Mentor - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
Little game based in The Big Bang Theory TV show. 
This little web project was made as a bonus challenge exercise.
The idea was to create a website in which you could play the Big Bang Theory Paper-Scissor-Rock-Lizard-Spock game as many times you want. 

Using CSS to create the animations and Java Script to create the simple rules.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can either choose the `original` designs for the simpler version or the `bonus` designs for the harder version. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
